<p>Hello, and welcome to our Terms and Conditions of Use.  This is important and affects your legal rights, so please
    read them and our <a href="/int/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> carefully. We hope you&rsquo;re sitting
    comfortably. Here we go…</p>

<h2><a name="s1">1.</a> Introductions</h2>

<p>Thanks for choosing Spotify <strong>(&ldquo;Spotify&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;).</strong>
    By using the Spotify service, websites, or software applications (together, the &ldquo;Spotify Service&rdquo; or &ldquo;Service&rdquo;),
    including by purchasing or receiving <a href="#s3-3">Codes or Limited Offers</a>, you are entering into a binding contract
    with our local company in your country of residence (your &ldquo;Local Country&rdquo;) if applicable or the company  listed in this <a href="#s19">chart</a>.
    Your agreement with us includes these Terms and Conditions of Use (<strong>&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;</strong>) and our
    <a href="/int/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> (together with the
    <a href="/int/legal/mobile-terms-and-conditions/">Mobile Terms</a> where applicable, the <strong>&ldquo;Agreements&rdquo;</strong>).
    If you don&rsquo;t agree with these Terms, then please don&rsquo;t use the Service.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re pleased to make our Service available to you. The Spotify Service includes social and interactive features.</p>

<p>In order to use the Spotify Service, you need to (a) be 18 or older, or be 13 or older and have your parent or
    guardian&rsquo;s consent to these Terms, (b) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and are not barred from
    doing so under any applicable laws, and (c) be resident in the Local Country. You also warrant that any registration
    information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.</p>

<h2><a name="s2">2.</a> Changes to the Agreements</h2>

<p>Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the Spotify Service and Agreements. When we make changes to
    the Agreements that we consider material, we&rsquo;ll notify you through the Service. By continuing to use the Service
    after those changes are made, you are expressing and acknowledging your acceptance of the changes.</p>

<h2><a name="s3">3. </a>Enjoying Spotify</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify. </p>

<h3><a name="s3-1"></a>3.1 Subscriptions</h3>

<p>Spotify account holders may access the Spotify Service by any of our several Subscriptions:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Free Service:</strong> an ad-based, free-of-charge service;</li>
    <li><strong>Unlimited Service:</strong> a subscription fee-based service;</li>
    <li><strong>Premium Service:</strong>  an ad-free, subscription fee-based service which enables you to listen to music
        while not connected to the internet, among other features; or</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Service:</strong> via a supported mobile handset.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Premium Service permits you to store cached content on up to three (3) personal computers, mobile handsets and/or
    other relevant devices (collectively &ldquo;Devices&rdquo;) while your Premium Service subscription is active. You may
    not transfer copies of cached content to any other device via any means. By using the Mobile Service, you agree to accept
    the Mobile Terms and to register for the Service as a mobile subscriber. The Premium Service and the Unlimited Service
    are hereinafter referred to as “Paid Subscriptions”.</p>

<h3><a name="s3-2"></a>3.2 Codes and other Limited Offers</h3>

<p>If you have purchased a code sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to the Unlimited Service or Premium Service
    for the time period indicated on your email, card or paper receipt (&ldquo;Code&rdquo;), or if you are accessing the service
    through some other limited offer which you received or purchased from Spotify (&ldquo;Limited Offer&rdquo;), these
    Agreements apply to your access to the Service. Any separate sets of terms and conditions presented to you along with
    the Code or other Limited Offer also apply to your access to the Service using the Code or Limited Offer. </p>

<p>Subject to any rights you may have under Section 12, Codes are only redeemable in the country where you purchased such
    Code, not redeemable for cash and may not be returned for a cash refund, exchanged, resold or used to purchase other Codes.</p>

<h3><a name="s3-3"></a>3.3 Trials</h3>

<p>From time to time, we may offer trials of the Premium Service and/or Mobile Service for a specified period without
    payment (a &ldquo;Trial&rdquo;). Spotify reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility
    for a Trial, and to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability.</p>

<p>For some Trials, we&rsquo;ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. At the end of such
    Trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the Premium Service on the first day following the end of the Trial,
    on a recurring monthly basis. By providing your payment details in conjunction with the Trial, you agree to this charge.
    If you do not want this charge, you must change your Subscription to the Free Service through your Spotify
    account&rsquo;s settings before the end of the Trial.</p>

<h2><a name="s4">4. </a>Licence and assignment</h2>

<p>The Spotify Service and the content provided through it are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors, and we
    grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable licence to make personal, non-commercial use of the Spotify Service and
    to receive the media content made available through the Spotify Service in your Local Country, based on the Subscription
    or Trial you have selected (the &ldquo;Licence&rdquo;). This Licence shall remain in effect for a period of 20 years
    unless terminated by you or Spotify. </p>

<p>The Spotify software applications are licensed, not sold, to you, and Spotify retains ownership of all copies of the
    Spotify software applications even after installation on your Devices. Spotify may assign these Agreements or any part
    of them without restrictions. You may not assign these Agreements or any part of them, nor transfer or sub-licence your
    rights under this Licence, to any third party. </p>

<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand
    are the sole property of Spotify. This Licence does not grant you any rights to use the Spotify trademarks, service
    marks, trade names, logos, domain names, or any other features of the Spotify brand, whether for commercial or
    non-commercial use.  </p>

<p>You agree to abide by our <a href="/int/legal/end-user-agreement/#s8">User Guidelines</a> and not to use the
    Spotify Service (including but not limited to its content) in any manner not expressly permitted by the Terms.</p>

<p>Third party software libraries included in the Spotify Service are licensed to you either under these Terms, or under
    the relevant third party software library&rsquo;s licence terms as published in the help or settings section of our
    desktop and mobile client and on our website. </p>

<h2><a name="s5">5. </a>Third Party Applications</h2>

<p>The Spotify Service provides a platform for third party applications, websites and services to make available
    products and services to you (<strong>&ldquo;Third Party Applications&rdquo;</strong>), and your use of these Third
    Party Applications is subject to their terms of use. You understand and agree that Spotify is not responsible or liable
    for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application. </p>

<h2><a name="s6">6.</a> User generated content</h2>

<p>Spotify users may post, upload and/or contribute (&ldquo;post&rdquo;) content to the Service, including pictures,
    text and playlist compilations (<strong>&ldquo;User Content&rdquo;</strong>). You represent that you have the right to
    post any User Content which you post to the Service, and that such User Content, or its use by us as contemplated by this
    Agreement, does not violate these Agreements, applicable law, or the intellectual property rights of others.  You grant
    us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any User Content that you post
    on or in connection with Spotify. This license lasts until you terminate your Spotify account, except in the case of User
    Content that you have published, made public and/or share with others. Aside from the rights specifically granted herein,
    you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content that you post to the Spotify
    Service, except that, where applicable under Local Country law, you agree to waive your right to be identified as the author
    of any User Content on the Spotify Service and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.</p>

<p>Spotify does not monitor, review, or edit User Content, but reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User
    Content for any or no reason, including but not limited to, User Content that, in Spotify&rsquo;s sole discretion, violates
    these Agreements. Spotify may take these actions without prior notification to you. Removal or disabling of access to User
    Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content. </p>

<p>Spotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in User Content. If you believe
    that any User Content infringes your intellectual property rights, please click <a href="/int/legal/copyright-policy">here</a>,
    or if you believe that any User Content does not comply with the User Guidelines (Section 8 below) or that your rights
    under applicable law have been otherwise infringed by any User Content, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:legal-feedback@spotify.com">legal-feedback@spotify.com</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="s7">7.</a> Consideration</h2>

<p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under these Terms, you grant us the right (a) to allow the Spotify
    Service to use the processor, bandwidth and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the
    Service, (b) to provide advertising and other information to you, if you subscribe to the Free Service, and (c) to allow
    our business partners to do the same.</p>

<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use,
    reproduce, make available to the public, publish, translate and distribute any User Content that you post on or otherwise
    provide through the Spotify Service. </p>

<p>These Terms are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and Spotify, and in no event shall these Terms create
    any third party beneficiary rights. Any failure by Spotify to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive
    Spotify’s right to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="s8">8.</a> User Guidelines</h2>

<p>We’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for
    everyone. Please follow these rules and encourage other users to do the same.</p>

<p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same. This means, for example, that the following
    is not permitted: (a) Copying, reproducing, “ripping”, recording, or making available to the public any part of the
    Spotify Services or content delivered to you via the Spotify Services, or otherwise any making use of the Spotify Service
    which is not expressly permitted under these Terms; (b) using the Spotify service to import or copy any local files you do
    not have the legal right to import or copy in this way; (c) reverse-engineering, decompiling, disassembling, modification
    or creating derivative works based on the Spotify Services or any part thereof; (d) circumventing any technology used by
    Spotify, its licensors, or any third party to protect content accessible through the Service; (e) renting or leasing of
    any part of the Services; (f) circumventing of any territorial restrictions applied by Spotify; (g) artificially increasing
    play count or otherwise manipulating the Services by using a script or other automated process; (h) removing or altering any
    copyright, trademark or other intellectual property notices contained on or provided through the Spotify Service; (i) providing
    your password to any other person or using any other person’s user name and password. </p>

<p>Please respect Spotify and other users of the Spotify Service. Don’t engage in any activity on the Service or upload
    User Content, including registering and/or using a username, which is or includes material that (a) is offensive, abusive,
    defamatory, pornographic or obscene; (b) is illegal, or intended to promote or commit an illegal act of any kind,
    including but not limited to, violations of intellectual property rights, privacy rights or proprietary rights of Spotify
    or a third party; (c) includes personal data of third parties or is intended to solicit such personal data, (d) includes
    malicious content such as malware, trojan horses or viruses, or otherwise interferes with any user’s access to the Service;

    person or entity, or is otherwise fraudulent, false, deceptive, or misleading; (g) uses automated means to artificially
    promote content; (h) involves the transmission of unsolicited mass mailing (“spam”), junk mail, chain letter, or similar,
    including through the Spotify inbox; (i) involves commercial or sales activities, such as advertising, contests, sweepstakes,
    or pyramid schemes; (j) promotes commercial products or services; (k) interferes with the Spotify Service, tampers with or
    attempts to probe, scan, or test for vulnerabilities in the Service or Spotify’s computer systems or network, or breaches
    any of Spotify’s security or authentication measures, or (l) conflicts with the Agreement, as determined by Spotify. You
    agree that Spotify may also reclaim your username for any reason.</p>

<p>Please be thoughtful about what you make public on Spotify. The Spotify Service includes social and interactive features,
    including the ability to post User Content, share content, and make certain information about you public, as further described
    in your account settings. Remember that shared or publicly available information may be used and re-shared by other users
    on Spotify or across the web, so please use Spotify carefully and manage your account settings regularly. Spotify has no
    responsibility for your choices to make any actions or material public on the Service. </p>

<p>Your password protects your user account, and you are solely responsible for keeping your password confidential and secure.
    You understand that you are responsible for all use of your username and password on the Service. If your username or
    password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account by third parties,
    please notify us immediately and change your password
    as soon as possible.</p>

<h2><a name="s9">9.</a> Copyright infringement</h2>

<p>Spotify respects the rights of intellectual property owners.  For details on Spotify&rsquo;s copyright policy, please
    <a href="/int/legal/copyright-policy/">click here</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="s10">10.</a> Technology limitations and modifications</h2>

<p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational. However, certain technical difficulties
    or maintenance may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions. Spotify reserves the right, periodically and
    at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with
    or without notice, all without liability to you for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify
    Service or any function or feature thereof. You understand and agree that Spotify has no obligation to maintain, support,
    upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.</p>

<h2><a name="s11">11.</a> Export control</h2>

<p>Spotify&rsquo;s products may be subject to U.S. export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the Export
    Administration Regulations (&ldquo;EAR&rdquo;) maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions
    maintained by the Treasury Department&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&ldquo;OFAC&rdquo;), and the International
    Traffic in Arms Regulations (&ldquo;ITAR&rdquo;) maintained by the Department of State.  You warrant that you are (1) not
    located in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria, and (2) are not a denied party as specified in the regulations listed
    above.</p>

<p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade
    and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR.  Specifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or
    indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology
    (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under these Agreements to any
    destination, entity, or person prohibited by the laws or regulations of the United States, without obtaining prior
    authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.  This export control
    clause shall survive termination or cancellation of these Agreements.</p>

<h2><a name="s12">12.</a> Payments, cancellations and cooling off</h2>

<p>If you reside in a Local Country which is part of the European Union and have purchased a Paid Subscription or Code online,
    you have the right to change your mind and receive a full refund within fourteen (14) days of purchase (the &ldquo;Cooling-off
    Period&rdquo;), but only if you have not logged in or otherwise redeemed or started to consume them.</p>

<p>If you have a Paid Subscription, your payment to Spotify will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period,
    unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page
    before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current
    subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service. However, if you cancel your payment and/or terminate
    the Terms after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), and/or before the end of the subscription period, we
    will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.</p>

<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions from time
    to time, and will communicate any price changes to you. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start
    of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. By continuing to use the Spotify Service after the
    price change takes effect, you accept the new price. </p>

<h2><a name="s13">13.</a> Term and termination</h2>

<p>These Terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify. Spotify may terminate the Terms
    or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorised
    use of the Spotify Service or non-compliance with the Terms.  If you or Spotify terminate the Terms, or if Spotify suspends
    your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you and Spotify
    will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. To learn
    how to terminate your Spotify account, please contact us through the Customer Service contact form.</p>

<h2><a name="s14">14.</a> Warranty</h2>

<p>We endeavor to provide the best service we can, but you understand and agree that THE SPOTIFY SERVICE IS PROVIDED
    &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. YOU USE THE SPOTIFY SERVICE AT YOUR
    OWN RISK.  SPOTIFY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    In addition, Spotify does not warrant, endorse, guarantee or assume responsibility for any Third Party Applications,
    Third Party Application content, User Content, or any other product or service advertised or offered by a third party on
    or through the Spotify Service or any hyperlinked website, or featured in any banner or other advertising.  You understand
    and agree that Spotify is not responsible or liable for any transaction between you and third-party providers of Third
    Party Applications or products or services advertised on or through the Spotify Service. As with any purchase of a product
    or service through any medium or in any environment, you should use your judgment and exercise caution where appropriate.
    No advice or information whether oral or in writing obtained by you from Spotify shall create any warranty on behalf of
    Spotify in this regard.  Some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions.</p>

<h2><a name="s15">15.</a> Limitation</h2>

<p>You agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, your sole and exclusive remedy for any problems or dissatisfaction
    with the Spotify Service, the Third Party Applications or the Third Party Application content is to uninstall any Spotify software
    and to stop using the Spotify Service, the Third Party Applications or the Third Party Application content.</p>

<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SPOTIFY, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
    DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (i) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT, REGARDLESS
    OF LEGAL THEORY, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER SPOTIFY HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A
    REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (ii) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, THIRD PARTY
    APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT MORE THAN THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO SPOTIFY DURING THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS IN QUESTION. </p>

<p>Nothing in these Agreements removes or limits Spotify&rsquo;s liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or
    personal injury caused by its negligence. Some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions.</p>

<h2><a name="s16">16.</a> Entire agreement</h2>

<p>These Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior
    agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral. Any additional or different
    terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter of the Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to
    Spotify are void. You represent that you have not accepted the Agreements in reliance on any oral or written representations
    made by Spotify that are not contained in the Agreements.</p>

<p>Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.
    That could include, for example, access to the Spotify Community for customer support, access to the Spotify Service as
    a result of a gift card, or free or discounted Trials.  You will agree to separate terms and conditions in those circumstances,
    which are listed in full <a href="/int/legal/links/">here</a>. Those terms and conditions shall
    govern only with regard to the aspect of the Service to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these
    Agreements, and do not supersede these Agreements.  To the extent that there is any conflict between those agreements and
    these Agreements, these Agreements shall control, except as otherwise provided in these Terms </p>

<p>Occasionally we may offer you the chance to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys (&ldquo;Special
    Promotions&rdquo;) through the Service. Special Promotions may be governed by terms and conditions that are separate
    from these Terms. If the provisions of a Special Promotion&rsquo;s terms and conditions conflict with these Terms, those
    separate terms and conditions shall prevail.</p>

<h2><a name="s17">17.</a> Severability</h2>

<p>Should any provision of the Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or
    enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Terms,
    and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2><a name="s18">18.</a> Choice of law, mandatory arbitration and venue</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, these
    Agreements are subject to the laws of Sweden, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.  Further, you and
    Spotify agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy that
    arises in connection with these Agreements.</p>

<p>If you are a United States user, the following mandatory arbitration provisions also apply to you:

<p>
<ol class="roman-list">
    <li>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Spotify
        Service or your use thereof, including our Agreements, shall be determined by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree
        that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and
        Spotify are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class or multi-party action.
        This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Agreements and the termination of your Spotify account.
        The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
        Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;), as modified by these Agreements,
        and as administered by the AAA. You and Spotify agree that these Agreements involve interstate commerce and are subject
        to the Federal Arbitration Act.</li>
    <li>You and Spotify agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine the validity or ownership of
        any intellectual property rights, and (b) any claims related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use of
        the Spotify Service are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and Spotify agree that these claims
        (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable relief) shall be exclusively decided by courts of
        competent jurisdiction in San Francisco County, California or New York, New York, and that applicable California
        and/or Federal law shall govern, without regard to choice of law principles.</li>
    <li>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
        NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, no arbitrator shall consolidate any
        other person&rsquo;s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class
        proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration
        section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief.</li>
    <li>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the
        date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise
        to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If
        applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the
        shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will
        be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by Spotify. Any arbitration
        costs or fees deemed &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; will be paid by Spotify.</li>
</ol>
